# Intercity Router (Oct '18 - Dec '18)
This was the course project for Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAoA).

Designed and built a web application to find the shortest path between two cities on dynamic user input. Used Backtracking and Dynamic Programming Techniques, implemented A-Star algorithm in JavaScript on the back end, used \href{http://js.cytoscape.org/}{Cytoscape} libraries for visualization of code. Wrote my own front end code in HTML5 and CSS to generate the map, show routes and handle user requests.
