# Intercity Router 
This was the course project for Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAoA).

Designed and built a web application to find the shortest path between two cities on dynamic user input. Used Backtracking and Dynamic Programming Techniques, implemented A-Star algorithm in JavaScript on the back end, used Cytoscape libraries for visualization of code. Wrote my own front end code in HTML5 and CSS to generate the map, show routes and handle user requests.
